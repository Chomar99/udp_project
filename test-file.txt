Hello World!

This is a test file for the UDP File Transfer System.

The system demonstrates:
- Real-time messaging between multiple clients
- File sharing with packet segmentation
- Reliable transfer over UDP
- Progress tracking
- Multi-threaded architecture

This file can be sent using the /file command.

Example usage:
Alice > /file test-file.txt

All connected clients (Bob, Charlie, etc.) will receive this file
and it will be saved in their received_files directory.

The file is split into 1024-byte chunks and transmitted over UDP
with acknowledgment and retransmission for reliability.

Enjoy testing the system!
